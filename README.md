# MPES in R

This GitHub respository stores the R code and data files to re-produce all analyses provided in the MPES tutorial paper.
The R script requires a user to specify their working directory, and within this directory create a folder called 'data' within which the .zip file of data should be stored.
This code requires rstan to be installed and functioning. To check rstan is installed correctly, please visit [this website](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).
