Notes on the code
single_arm_mode #TRUE or FALSE #Choose whether to run for a single-arm or not (i.e., exclude the HR aspect, and only produce estimates for the intervention arm)
gen_pop_adjust #TRUE or FALSE #Choose whether or not to include the general population adjustment aspect of the MPES method
hr_adjust #TRUE or FALSE #Choose whether or not to include the HR adjustment aspect of the MPES method
max_surv #Time point which represents the absolute maximum survival for the population (years from baseline)
plot_lim_x #limit for x axis in years
plot_breaks_x #breaks for x axis in years
iter_spec #Iterations for Stan. Note: may be worth changing to 5,000 to ensure this is stable

For the analyses including both SEER and general population conditional survival information,
the general population numerator at 34 years was 23,080, and the denominator 30,196; representing an estimated 76.4% 1-year conditional survival
see Appendix B of the Guyot paper for all of the raw data
For a two-arm model, user can impose assumption on HR from a specific time point, base-case in Guyot had HR of 1 with SD of 0.1 'kick in' at 6 years until 28 years
hr = 1, sd = 0.1, start = 6, end = 28.
